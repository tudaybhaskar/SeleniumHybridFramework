BestPractice 1:
Create an interface of LoginPage.
Create a AppLoginPage that implements the LoginPage.

The advantage of doing this is : LoginPage interface is implemented by many loginPages. In the future , if we have another loginPage
we can use the interface and this makes more easy to maintain , scalable and modular.
